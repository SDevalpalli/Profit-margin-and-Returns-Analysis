# Profit-margin-and-Returns-Analysis

The objective of this project was to conduct a product-focused business assessment to best understand profit margin considering the returns. Several KPIs were inspected to understand the top 10 profitable brands and gross profit against the returns.

Through the product-based analysis, we looked into the performance of several products and their brands to see the profit margins and the returns. We then recommended actionable suggestions by focusing on the best brands based on the KPIs below:

* Profit Margin
* Gross Profit
* Refund Amount

The tools used in this project are as follows:

* SQL using BigQuery
* Microsoft Power BI
* Microsoft Powerpoint

Below is the finalised dashboard used in the reports of the project:
